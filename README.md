### Useful npm scripts
If you simply intend to work on the front end (React, CSS, Axios, etc.), you'll want to run <code>npm start</code>, so that the server will start and continue to run seamlessly, and you'll be able to see your changes every time you save.

If you intend to work on the back end of the site (express, Sequelize, etc.), you'll want to run <code>npm run dev</code>, so that the server will restart whenever you save changes.
